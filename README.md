## Branching Strategies
Since the team is comprised of only one person, the chosen branching strategy for CMPG323 projects is the trunk-based development strategy. The defining feature of this strategy is that development is done on the main branch, with temporary feature branches that are quickly merged onto the main branch.

## The use of .gitignore Files
.gitignore files will be included in the project repositories as these file are exempted from the version control operations of git and as such these files will not affect the source code but may be temporary files that could aid with the development of the projects and also some .gitignore files may contain some sensitive data that has to remain unaltered.

## Storage of Credentials and Sensetive Information
Github has a dedicated security feature, GitHub secrets, pertaining to the protection of sensitive information. With this feature, github provides encryption and the sensitive information can be accessed via workflows without hard coding it in source code.
