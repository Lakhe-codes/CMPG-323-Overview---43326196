## Branching Strategies
Since the team is very, comprised of only one person to be precise, the chosen branching strategy for project 2 is the trunk-based development strategy. Because the defining feature of this strategy is that development is done on the main branch, with shortlived feature branches that are quickly merged onto the main branch.
The Github flow branching strategy will be used for project 3 and 4. This branching strategies uses branches for changes to the source code which are later merged onto the main branch.
